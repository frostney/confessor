{"name":"Confessor","body":"Colipas\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCommand-line library for FreePascal/Delphi\r\n\r\nColipas is inspired by Commander (http://visionmedia.github.com/commander/) and Commander.js (http://tjholowaychuk.com/post/9103188408/commander-js-nodejs-command-line-interfaces-made-easy). Originally, I wanted to name the project Commander.pas, but because it's not a 1:1 port of the Commander interface, Colipas was the next name I came up with.\r\n\r\nSorry, if a few functions/procedures are a bit verbose. I've been doing a lot of Objective-C lately.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Uses callbacks to actions  \r\n- Utilize lists  \r\n- Confirm messages (yes/no)  \r\n- Prompts with additional default statement  \r\n- Add options to your command-line apps as one or multiple char, one or more strings or both of those options  \r\n- Options with parameter support  \r\n- Supports LibNotify and Growl (through GrowlNotify) if available  \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n  1. Include Colipas in your application  \r\n  2. Sub-class TCommandApp  \r\n  3. Implement the method Execute in your sub-class and make sure it calls the inherited method  \r\n  4. Create an instance of your sub-class.  \r\n  5. In your main code file add call the methods you need, for example:  \r\n       MySubClass.Print(SomeString, [poLibNotify, poGrowl]); //< This send a notification to LibNotify or Growl if available  \r\n       MySubClass.Option('s', 'someoption', @CallbackToMyOption); //< If the user would be call the application with the parameter  \r\n         // -s or --someoption, CallbackToMyOption would be called, whereas CallbackMyOption should be implemented as a method of MySubClass  \r\n  6. Call MySubClass.Execute  \r\n  (You need to rename MySubClass to the actual class)  \r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  Some features are missing when using Colipas on Windows.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSee the examples for detailed information on usage.  \r\n\r\nIt is recommended to use Colipas with InstantFPC (http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/InstantFPC).  \r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMIT license, see LICENSE.txt for more information.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\n(C) Johannes Stein 2011  \r\nhttp://www.freeze-dev.com  \r\njohannesstein@freeze-dev.com  \r\n","tagline":"Command line library for FreePascal/Delphi","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
